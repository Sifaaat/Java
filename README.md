# Java OOP Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice codes**, developed as part of my learning journey in **Software Engineering**.  
The focus of this repository is to build a **strong foundation in Java OOP concepts** through simple, real-life examples.

---

## 📌 Overview

- Language: **Java**
- Core Focus: **Class, Object, Constructor, Methods**
- Level: **Beginner to Intermediate**
- Purpose: **Academic practice, revision, and concept clarity**

---

## 📚 Concepts Covered

- Class and Object fundamentals
- Constructors (default & parameterized)
- Method declaration and calling
- Object creation and usage
- Real-world entity modeling using Java
- Basic program structure and syntax

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each Java file represents a **specific concept or example**, organized sequentially for better understanding:

| File Name | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `01_teacher.java` | Teacher class and constructor example |
| `02_test.java` | Test class for output verification |
| `03_University.java` | University class with constructor |
| `04_Tour.java` | Tour-related object modeling |
| `05_ClassObject.java` | Demonstration of class & object |
| `06_Method_Car.java` | Method implementation using Car object |
| `07_Professor.java` | Professor class with constructor |

> 🔢 File numbering is used to maintain a **clear learning order**.
